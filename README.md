# Game Audio Manager Explorer

Game Audio Manager Explorer (GAME) is a software tool designed to help you efficiently manage your libraries of audio files, including both sound effects and music. It is specifically tailored to assist in finding the perfect tracks for games or any other project.

## Features 🌟

- **Asynchronous subfolder scanning:** select a main directory, and the app will scan for any audio files within, even if there is a very large number of files.

- **Wide format support:** compatible with .mp3, .wav, .ogg, and .flac file formats.

- **Metadata display:** presents audio files in a minimalistic and clean table, displaying the title, artist, album, and length of each track.

- **Easy track control and navigation:** click on a track to start playing it, scroll through tracks using arrow keys, and press Enter to start or stop playback.

- **Easy export:** click on the "Open Directory" button to quickly access the directory at the file path.

- **Track filtering:** filter tracks by keyword, excluded keyword, or maximum length to easily find the audio files you need.

## Installation 🛠️

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate into the program directory
3. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

4. Still in the terminal, start the program by running:

`npm run dev`

NOTE: you also need Node.js installed on your machine.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to create a working build at this time, so a click-and-run package is not available. For the details check the [related issue](https://github.com/stesproject/game-audio-manager-explorer/issues/1).

## What's Next 🔮

I would like to enhance the program with the following useful features:

- **Column-specific keyword filtering**: implement the ability to filter by keyword directly within each column, allowing users to filter by title, artist, or album. The filter by maximum length be at the top of the corresponding column.

- **Column sorting**: enable sorting of columns alphabetically and by track length.

- **Favorites tab**: introduce a feature to save files to a "Favorites" tab.

- **Project grouping**: allow users to group files into specific "projects" for streamlined management and easy export in the future.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are highly welcome!

While I am a web developer and use React and Vite in my daily work, this is my first project using Electron, and some aspects were quite challenging.

If you would like to enhance the program or add new features, your contributions would be greatly appreciated!

Please check the open issues for more details.
